<a href='https://www.math.umass.edu/seminars/TWIGS'>The What Is... Graduate Seminar (TWIGS)</a> was originally founded by Farshid Hajir in 2002 as a way for graduate students to learn about faculty research interests in an accessible forum. After a brief hiatus, TWIGS is returning (in online form). Talks will be given by Department faculty on topics related to their research.

Jobs of TWIGS coordinators are mainly

<ul>
    <li>inviting faculties for giving talks,</li>
    <li>organizing and hosting talks and</li>

In Fall 2022, the talks were given by zoom in purpose of recording the talks and sharing the playlists in Youtube among department members. <br>
In Spring 2024, inperson talks were back.
