    - title: Lipschitz regularized generative particles algorithm
      items:
        - Implementation of a particle transportation algorithm through gradient flows associated with Lipschitz regularized f-divergences.
        - A generative model alternative to GANs in low training data regimes.
        - Mathematical interpretation of applying spectral normalization on neural network discriminators as a particle transportation speed regularization.
    - title: Wasserstein 1 / Wasserstein 2 proximal generative flow
      items:
        - Formulated and implemented a generative model with continuous-time adversarial flow architecture for learning distributions that are supported on low-dimensional manifolds.
        - Our formulation is analyzed via Mean Field Game theory and ensures good properties of the learned flow such as uniqueness of solution and optimal (linear) paths.
