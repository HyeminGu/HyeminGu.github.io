**Abstract**
A lattice in the Euclidean space is an important issue for cryptography these days. In general it is very challenging to find a nonzero shortest vector because of its computational difficulties. People are interested in sufficient conditions for a basis including a nonzero shortest vector. However, there are few researches on properties of bases having a nonzero shortest vector. In low dimensions, gaussianity of basis vectors is a key factor to be a shortest vector of a lattice among basis vectors of the lattice. In this article, first of all, in dimension 2, we introduce that we already know an algorithm that makes any basis vectors of a lattice gaussian. Therefore, the shortest basis vector is shortest in the lattice and the inverse is also true. In dimension 3, we prove a necessary condition having this property and suggest an algorithm to make basis vectors of any basis for a lattice pair-wise gaussian. Moreover we conclude that if the shortest basis vector is shortest in a lattice, basis vectors are pairwise-gaussian and has another property. Finally we can combine the minimal sufficient condition that has already been proven by others with our results so that we have a necessary and sufficient condition for a shortest vector in a lattice in dimension 3.
