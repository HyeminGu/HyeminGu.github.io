**Abstract**
The Lorenz model is a dynamical system of three first order differential equations. It was designed by Lorenz as a simplified model of atmospheric convection. This project assumes that the Earth's atmosphere is an incompressible fluid situated between two horizontal planes. Using governing equations in 2D hydrodynamics, the steps of Lorenz are followed to derive the Lorenz equations from an abstract climate model. Then, properties of the Lorenz equations are explored and illustrated by individual examples and their interpretations.
