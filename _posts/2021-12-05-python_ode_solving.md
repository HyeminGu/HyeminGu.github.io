## 1. Python Tutorial and JupyterNotebook Setup

If you need an assist to setup your computer to handle numerical computations and showing interactive results, this 15-min video would give you the first step.

## 3. PINN for Dynamical systems
This 18 min video would provide you the tutorial to "Implementation and Python Library Tutorial for PINNs to Handle Dynamical Systems".

Lorenz model and its inverse/forward problems are chosen as the example for dynamical systems.

I attached the modified example code for forward/inverse Lorenz model in jupyter notebook (ipnb) and the slides.
